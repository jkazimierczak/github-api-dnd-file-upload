# GitHub API Drag & Drop File Upload POC

This is a proof of concept for a drag & drop file upload using the GitHub API.  
It also handles upload of multiple files sequentially.

> [!CAUTION]
> This POC doesn't handle any errors and is not production ready.

## Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Create a new personal access token with the `repo` scope
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all the required fields
4. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the server
